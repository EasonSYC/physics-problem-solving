# Physics Problem Solving

This is a compilation of question, notes and presentations for Physics Problem Solving Society happening at my school.

The copyright of the original questions remain that of BPhO, and I would like to thank BPhO for providing these excellent questions..

This repository is meant to be a place to store and share these resources.

Many thanks to my friends, Lev and Dara for running this with me, and our teacher, Mr Swartzentruber for supporing and supervising the society.
